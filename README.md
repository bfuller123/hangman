# hangman
A responsive game of hangman with three different flavors!

This game of hangman is all front-end based, and uses a separate javascript file that is loaded in to act as a sudo-database to make it so the user doesn't have to ever hit a different page once loaded. For future development this will be turned into a PWA to allow offline abilities with the app.
